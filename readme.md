This is a "train of though" guide for Kubernetes.
To get the most out of the guide install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), clone the repository and open it as a vault.

Note that this guide is not designed to be a comprehensive introduction/guide to Kubernetes, but rather a collection of things I've learned and want to remember. As such it might not always contain best practices.

If you find a mistake or have suggestions feel free to file an issue or create a pull request.
